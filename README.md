# se_library_landing_page

This is my first offical project that I did to stary my career as software engineer. 

This project showcases my design skill of a website by using BEM,flexbox,postioning and much more. 

My main focus was implenting the use of flex display and putting into practice throughout this project. 

The use of flex display is a very important tool when designing a website using BEM structure, it's a powerful tool that lets you control the flow of a website , and its design.
